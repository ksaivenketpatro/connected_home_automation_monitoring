## Higher Level Plan

### 1. **Research and Familiarization**
**Objective**: Prepare by understanding the technologies and components to be used.
- **Study Embedded Communication Protocols**: Learn about **I2C**, **SPI**, and **UART** protocols for communication between devices.
- **RTOS Basics**: Understand how a **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** functions in managing multiple tasks in an embedded system.
- **IoT Protocols**: Research **MQTT** and **HTTP** protocols for sending data over the network.

### 2. **Room Modules Development**
**Objective**: Design and build the room modules to collect environmental data.
- **Sensor Selection**: Choose appropriate sensors (e.g., **DHT22** for temperature and humidity).
- **Module Design**: Implement the module using **ESP32**, with communication using **I2C/SPI** for sensors and **Wi-Fi** for data transfer.
- **Firmware Development**: Write firmware to read sensor data and send it to the central dashboard via **Wi-Fi**.
- **Testing**: Test room module data collection and transmission to ensure accuracy.

### 3. **Central Dashboard Setup**
**Objective**: Create a physical dashboard to display data from all rooms.
- **Display Integration**: Set up an **OLED/LCD** display to show temperature and humidity data.
- **Wi-Fi Communication**: Ensure that the central dashboard can receive data from room modules over **Wi-Fi**.
- **RTOS Implementation**: Use **RTOS** to handle multiple tasks (data collection, display updates, Wi-Fi communication) on the dashboard.
- **Data Aggregation**: Integrate data from all room modules and update the display in real-time.

### 4. **Aquarium and Plant Automation Systems**
**Objective**: Build and automate the aquarium and plant systems.
- **Sensor Integration**: Choose sensors (e.g., temperature sensors for aquarium, soil moisture sensors for plants).
- **Automation Logic**: Develop logic to control actuators (e.g., pumps, watering systems) based on sensor readings.
- **RTOS for Automation**: Implement **RTOS** to handle periodic tasks like activating the pump or watering system.
- **Testing**: Test the automation logic for both the aquarium and plant modules.

### 5. **Web Application for Remote Monitoring**
**Objective**: Create a web application to remotely monitor and control the system.
- **Web App Design**: Develop a simple web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to display room, aquarium, and plant data.
- **Web App-Device Communication**: Implement **MQTT** or **HTTP** to send data from the **ESP32** devices to the web app.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time data updates using **WebSockets** or **HTTP polling**.
- **Control Interface**: Allow users to interact with the system (e.g., turning lights or pumps on/off) via the web app.

### 6. **System Integration and Testing**
**Objective**: Integrate all modules and test the system as a whole.
- **Room Module Integration**: Ensure each room module communicates with the central dashboard and transmits data correctly.
- **Aquarium and Plant Module Integration**: Integrate the aquarium and plant modules, ensuring automation is working based on sensor readings.
- **Web App Testing**: Ensure that the web app is receiving real-time data and can be used to control actuators.
- **System Debugging**: Troubleshoot any communication or sensor issues and resolve them.

### 7. **Power Management and Optimization**
**Objective**: Improve power efficiency and optimize communication.
- **Power Optimization for ESP32**: Use sleep modes and low-power modes in **ESP32** for energy efficiency.
- **Wi-Fi and Network Optimization**: Minimize data transmission frequency to reduce network load and power consumption.
- **Efficient Firmware**: Ensure firmware is optimized for minimal resource usage while maintaining real-time performance.

### 8. **Documentation and Final Presentation**
**Objective**: Document the entire process and prepare for project presentation.
- **Document Design and Code**: Create a detailed documentation of the system design, including circuit diagrams, communication protocols, and code explanations.
- **GitHub**: Upload and maintain the codebase.

### 9. **Scalability and Future Enhancements**
**Objective**: Prepare the system for future upgrades and scalability.
- **Scalable Communication**: Ensure that adding new rooms or modules (e.g., additional sensors) can be done easily without significant changes to the existing system.
- **Future Features**: Explore adding more advanced features like automatic control of room temperature, integrating more sensors, or implementing voice control (using Google Assistant or Alexa).
- **Cloud Integration**: Research cloud-based integration to allow remote monitoring and control via the web app from anywhere.

### 10. **Final Review and Testing**
**Objective**: Finalize the project, test everything together, and ensure everything is working seamlessly.
- **Full System Test**: Conduct a comprehensive test of the entire system (room modules, dashboard, web app, automation) to ensure all components function as expected.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Have potential users interact with the system (e.g., turning on/off devices, checking room conditions) and ensure ease of use and reliability.
