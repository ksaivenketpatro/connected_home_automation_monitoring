## Objectives

### 1. **Understand and Implement Embedded Communication Protocols**
- Learn to implement and work with various communication protocols used in embedded systems, such as **I2C**, **SPI**, and **UART** to interact with sensors and actuators in the system.
- Choose the appropriate protocol for different components based on data transfer speed, power consumption, and system complexity.

### 2. **Implement Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**
- Understand the concept of **RTOS** and implement it to manage concurrent tasks (e.g., reading sensors, controlling actuators, sending data, updating displays) efficiently.
- Use RTOS to ensure that tasks are executed in a time-sensitive manner, ensuring real-time responsiveness.

### 3. **Room Module Integration**
- Design and build the room modules that will monitor environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) and send this data to the central dashboard.
- Use **I2C** or **SPI** for sensor data communication and implement **UART** or **Wi-Fi** for sending data to the central dashboard and web app.

### 4. **Central Dashboard Design**
- Develop a physical central dashboard that will receive data from all rooms and display relevant details (e.g., temperature, humidity) for monitoring.
- Use **Wi-Fi** for communication between the room modules and the central dashboard.
- Implement **RTOS** to handle different tasks like sensor data update, display refresh, and communication with the web app.

### 5. **Develop and Integrate Automation for Aquarium and Plant Modules**
- Build automation modules for monitoring and controlling environmental factors in the aquarium (e.g., water temperature, pump control) and plant system (e.g., soil moisture, watering system).
- Use appropriate sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, moisture sensors) with **I2C**, **SPI**, or **UART** for communication.
- Implement time-based automation using **RTOS**, such as triggering pumps or watering systems based on conditions.

### 6. **Web Application for Remote Monitoring and Control**
- Create a **web app** that will allow users to remotely monitor and control the central dashboard, room modules, aquarium, and plant modules.
- Use **MQTT** or **HTTP** for real-time data transfer between the embedded devices and the web app.

### 7. **Real-time Data Updates and Interaction**
- Ensure that the system provides **real-time updates** to both the central dashboard and the web app using **Wi-Fi** or **MQTT** for data transfer.
- Implement automation, like turning on lights or fans based on temperature, humidity, and other sensor readings.

### 8. **Implement Scalable Communication System**
- Design the system in a way that can be easily scaled to additional rooms or modules in the future.
- Use **MQTT** for scalability, where each room/module publishes its data to a central server that aggregates the data and communicates with the dashboard and web app.

### 9. **Debugging and Optimization**
- Learn **debugging techniques** to troubleshoot communication issues, sensor malfunctions, and actuator failures in embedded systems.
- Optimize the system for low power consumption, especially for room modules that will always be on.

### 10. **Achieve Seamless Integration Between Embedded Devices and Web App**
- Implement seamless integration between embedded devices and the web app, ensuring that sensor data from the room, aquarium, and plant systems is transmitted to the web app for remote monitoring.
- Allow real-time interactions between the dashboard and the web app (e.g., turning on/off devices, checking status).

### 11. **Documentation and Presentation**
- Document the design, implementation, and architecture of the system.
- Create a **presentation** to explain how the system works, the communication protocols used, the role of **RTOS** in managing tasks, and how the system can be extended in the future.
